If you have a DICOM with JPG2000, dcm2nii will not convert it.

You need to use the program gdcm to write the DICOM back to raw

use this command: gdcmconv.fs -w -i infile -o outfile

or batch it...
#!/bin/tcsh

foreach file (IM-0001-0001-0001.dcm  IM-0001-0016-0001.dcm  IM-0001-0031-0001.dcm  IM-0001-0046-0001.dcm )

gdcmconv.fs -w -i $file -o 'dec_'$file

end
